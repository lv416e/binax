# BinAX: JAX-Based Reinforcement Learning for Bin Packing

## Project Overview

BinAX is a high-performance reinforcement learning framework for solving bin packing problems using JAX. The project leverages JAX's functional programming paradigm, automatic differentiation, and XLA compilation to achieve state-of-the-art performance in both training efficiency and solution quality.

## Implementation Architecture

### 1. Environment Design

#### 1.1 Problem Formulation
- **Objective**: Minimize the number of bins required to pack all items
- **Constraints**: Each item must fit within bin capacity, no item splitting allowed
- **Variants**: 1D bin packing (initial focus), extensible to 2D/3D variants

#### 1.2 Markov Decision Process (MDP) Formulation
- **State Space**: Current bin configurations, remaining items, capacity utilization
- **Action Space**: Selection of target bin for current item (with option to open new bin)
- **Reward Function**: Negative reward for opening new bins, positive reward for efficient packing
- **Terminal State**: All items successfully packed

### 2. Neural Network Architecture

#### 2.1 State Representation
```
State = {
    bin_states: [B, C],        # B bins, C capacity per bin
    item_queue: [N, 1],        # N remaining items with sizes
    current_item: [1],         # Size of current item to pack
    bin_utilization: [B],      # Current utilization ratio per bin
    step_count: [1]            # Current packing step
}
```

#### 2.2 Policy Network
- **Input Processing**: Multi-head attention for bin-item interactions
- **Feature Extraction**: Convolutional layers for spatial patterns
- **Decision Head**: Softmax over valid actions (available bins + new bin)
- **Value Head**: State value estimation for advantage computation

#### 2.3 Value Network
- **Shared Backbone**: With policy network for parameter efficiency
- **Architecture**: Deep residual networks with skip connections
- **Output**: Scalar value function approximation

### 3. Reinforcement Learning Algorithm

#### 3.1 Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- **Advantages**: Stable training, sample efficiency, robust hyperparameters
- **Clip Ratio**: ε = 0.2 for policy updates

#### 3.2 Training Configuration
- **Batch Size**: 2048 experiences per update
- **Mini-batch Size**: 256 for gradient computation
- **Learning Rate**: 3e-4 with cosine annealing
- **Discount Factor**: γ = 0.99
- **GAE Lambda**: λ = 0.95 for advantage estimation
